# Strategy Pattern

* The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, 
and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

# Design principles

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* Favor composition over inheritance.


# Bullet points

* Knowing the OO basics does not make you a good OO designer.
* Good OO designs are reusable, extensible, and maintainable.
* Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO design qualities.
* Patterns are proven object-oriented experience.
* Patterns don’t give you code, they give you general solutions to design problems. You apply them to your specific application.
* Patterns aren’t invented, they are discovered.
* Most patterns and principles address issues of change in software.
* Most patterns allow some part of a system to vary independently of all other parts.
* We often try to take what varies in a system and encapsulate it.
* Patterns provide a shared language that can maximize the value of your communication with other developers.
